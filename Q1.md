Big O notation rules:
1. Constant time O(1): Algorithm runs in constant time if the runtime doesn’t rely on the input size. Example: Accessing element in an array.
2.  Quadratic Time O(n²): The runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size. Example: Nested loops.
3.Ignore Constants and Lower-Order Terms: Big O notation focuses on the dominant term as the input size grows. Example: If an algorithm has a runtime of 3n² + 2n + 1, it is simplified to O(n²) because n² dominates as n grows.
4. Logarithmic Time O(log n):  The runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
5. Linear Time: O(n): The runtime grows linearly with the input size. Example: Iterating through an array.
