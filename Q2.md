
Differences between arrays and linked lists.

Memory allocation:  Arrays require pre allocation of memory while linked lists have their memory allocated dynamically as nodes are added.

Performance: Arrays have fast access to elements by index while linked lists have slow access to elements by index because of traversal.

Insertion and deletion operations: For arrays, Insertion/deletion at the end is efficient while for linked lists, Insertion/deletion at the beginning is efficient.
